## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While I improved my understanding of Flexbox and CSS Grid — especially grid row spanning and layout grouping — my biggest takeaway here was learning how to handle breakpoints properly.

I built the layout, resized the viewport over and over using devTools, and introduced breakpoints **only** when the design visually required a change.

I also learned how to use clamp() better. This is something I keep having trouble with every time I use it, but I'm slowly getting there.

### Continued development

In the future I want to keep learning about clamp(), CSS Grid and mobile-first workflow.
